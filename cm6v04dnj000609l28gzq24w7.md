I am very happy with the response from my previous post, so I decided to add turnout comparisons, with special thanks to Chris Hanretty for the idea.

As you can see, turnout dropped steeply in 2024 across the board, but particularly in more deprived areas (turnout was 49% in the most deprived decile). It is worth noting that the government introduced voter ID laws which also had a turnout effect in local elections.

Thank you for reading my blog!
