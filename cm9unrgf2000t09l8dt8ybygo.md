As you are probably well aware, Trump has decided to tariff many countries, weakening growth both domestically and internationally. [Lawrence McKay](https://bsky.app/profile/lawrencemckay.bsky.social), a political scientist, asked me to see if this was having any effect on the upcoming 2025 Canadian Election. Canada depends on American trade, [exporting about three quarters of its goods there.](https://financialpost.com/news/economy/u-s-benefits-from-canadian-trade) This is not to suggest it’s an unbalanced relationship, as America also exports lots of goods to Canada.

YouGov has handily come out with an [MRP on the Canadian Elections](https://yougov.co.uk/politics/articles/52054-first-yougov-mrp-2025-canadian-federal-election-shows-liberals-on-track-to-win-modest-majority-poll), projecting a ‘modest’ majority for the governing Liberal Party.

There also exists the [IRPP study](https://irpp.org/research-studies/measuring-community-workforce-exposure-to-us-exports/) on how much Canadian Census Districts are affected by American exports.

The trend is fairly modest, a linear correlation of -0.16 with a P Value of 0.003 (rejecting the null hypothesis). This is only a weak relationship, but the data was interesting to collate nonetheless.

Broken down by industry, Steel and Iron Mills have the strongest Pearson correlation of -0.195 (P Value 0.0003). This is one of the big exports from Canada to America, so the effect here is not too unsurprising.
