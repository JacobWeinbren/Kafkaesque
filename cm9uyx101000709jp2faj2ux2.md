Canada has various methods of deprivation. For this analysis, I have picked the [Material and Social Deprivation Index](https://www.inspq.qc.ca/en/deprivation/material-and-social-deprivation-index). This is not to be confused with the more popular CIMD (which I have found a bit confusing/un-initiative). The YouGov MRP can be found [here](https://yougov.co.uk/politics/articles/52054-first-yougov-mrp-2025-canadian-federal-election-shows-liberals-on-track-to-win-modest-majority-poll). This is a less “interesting” finding, so I am just posting on my blog mostly for future reference.  
  
Socially deprived voters are more likely to vote for the Liberals and NDP, and respectively less likely to vote for the Conservatives.

Whereas economically, the Liberals have more of a “high low” coalition akin to the Democrats in America (up until recently).
