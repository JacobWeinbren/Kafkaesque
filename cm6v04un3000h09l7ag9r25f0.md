The Scottish Census is a really important source of information about the population across Scotland. The 2022 Census data so far covers age, ethnicity, national identity, religion, language skills, and household composition. But more releases are coming [down the line](https://www.scotlandscensus.gov.uk/about/2022-census/census-outputs-schedule/)!

For this blog post, I mapped the Scottish Census, overlayed onto Scottish buildings and colour coded it. The full code is on [Github](https://github.com/JacobWeinbren/Scottish-Census).

I hope you find it as interesting as I do!
