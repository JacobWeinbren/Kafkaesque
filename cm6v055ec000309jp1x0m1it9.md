Hi all,

With the local election results behind us, I thought I would calculate the ward changes by deprivation. Thank you a lot to [Election Maps UK](https://ko-fi.com/electionmapsuk) and [Ben Walker](https://twitter.com/BNHWalker) for the data.

The main findings is the surprising swing from Labour to independents in working class Muslim/Student areas. This could cause trouble for Labour if it enters government.

Labour has also made inroads in middle-of-the-road areas, which it will need to do to gain a majority.

The Greens pull seats from both environmental Conservative and Labour voters. The Liberal Democrats continue to gain in southern, middle class areas. And the Tories make widespread losses.

The code, as ever, is on [Github](https://github.com/JacobWeinbren/2024-LE-Deprivation).
