Yesterday an author called Jonn Elledge asked why the East Coast of England was as right wing as it was. This led by down a long rabbit hole.

To try and solve this problem, I made this tool which combines census and deprivation indices with the party political performance of constituencies. I hope you find it as interesting as I do!  
  
I would like to thank Lawrence McKay for the help behind this.
