To compare with the [YouGov MRP](https://yougov.co.uk/politics/articles/52054-first-yougov-mrp-2025-canadian-federal-election-shows-liberals-on-track-to-win-modest-majority-poll), I worked out all the census attribute proportions for every riding. And I put all the thousands of variables in a sheet, and correlated them with 3 variables:

* Conservative Voteshare (2025 Projected)
    
* Liberal Voteshare (2025 Projected)
    
* Conservative-Liberal Swing (2021-2025 Projected)
    

You can see all the data below, but itâ€™s a bit messy. So I have summarised it here for those curious.

One thing I want to point out, is something called the ecological fallacy. Basically it means the people of a riding may not represent the individuals. For instance, in the American South, there is a sizeable Black population and a sizeable Republican population. So if you correlated the two, might find a relationship between the two. However, southern Black voters in America tend not actually to vote Republican.
