Based on the great spreadsheet compiled last year, I have moved all the Hebrew Duolingo cards to Mochi. Mochi is like Anki flashcards, but it has an improved UI and better mobile support.

[https://app.mochi.cards/decks/af62b0c1-64e8-4db4-8875-0dd323f4f67b/M6ZIEbBg/Hebrew-Vocabulary](https://app.mochi.cards/decks/af62b0c1-64e8-4db4-8875-0dd323f4f67b/M6ZIEbBg/Hebrew-Vocabulary) - the link is a bit slow to load all the cards

You can still find the Duolingo Anki Cards here as well - [https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/849529857](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/849529857)

The main things to note are the following:

* Archive (i.e. hide) the particular sets that you don't want to study
    
* Do not expect to learn all ~5300 cards in one day
    
* Enable reverse mode so you can see Hebrew/English and English/Hebrew
    
* Feel free to email me with updates/suggestions/criticisms/changes - jacobweinbren@gmail.com
