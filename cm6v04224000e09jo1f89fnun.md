Hi,  
  
Due to hosting costs, I have deleted my Canadian Census map (costing £10 a month) and my Israeli Machine Learning Tool (costing £5 a month). I have done some checks, and it shows that not enough people are using them to justify the cost.  
  
When I am famous and successful, I will not have this problem. For now, practical matters take first place.  
  
I hope you can understand. The code is still on the respective Github Pages.  
  
Jacob
