Hello - it has been a while. I am currently focusing on my dissertation and university. I thought I would share these maps of the 2022 Local Elections.

Sadly, the public data for Northern Ireland is less accessible, so these maps are just of Great Britain. Many parts of England (and occasionally wards in Wales/Scotland) did also not have elections.

As ever, the source code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/JacobWeinbren/2022-LE). Thanks in particular to Britain Elects and Electoral Calculus for the maps and results.

> Sean from The Social Review has written a [really interesting analysis of the local elections](https://www.thesocialreview.co.uk/2022/05/15/local-elections-breakdown/) - I would highly recommend it.
