Greetings to all Hebrew enthusiasts!

This has been many months in the making - and I am super excited to share

This is the most comprehensive Anki Card Set ever made based on the Hebrew course on Duolingo. This set doesn’t just introduce you to words but delves into their conjugations. Each card offers transliterations, translations, and additional insights about the word, helping you learn its usage and context better.

* [Card Set Link](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/849529857)
    
* [Source code](https://github.com/JacobWeinbren/Memrise-Duolingo)
    
* [Discussion Forum](https://forum.duome.eu/viewtopic.php?t=14446-request-someone-who-has-finished-hebrew-course-incomplete-vocab)
    
* [Source Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1abxso4ZnnZ_fPQv4aWf5vwmvLYODcofahH_MncB8-nE/edit)
    

### This set includes three card formats:

1. **Hebrew to English (multiple choice)**: Helps in familiarizing and recognizing the Hebrew script.

I can highly recommend installing [Anki Heatmap](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1771074083?ref=kafkaesque.digitalpress.blog) as it helps so much with the learning process.

I want to pause for a moment to give immense gratitude to the incredible individuals who played pivotal roles in the fruition of this project. With thousands of words and countless hours over many months, the dedication and passion demonstrated by *Corinnebelle*, *PtolemysXX*, *EranBarLev*, *dakanga*, *MatOzone*, [*Heilswahrheit*](https://duolinguists.wordpress.com/2022/03/23/duolingo-hebrew-course-vocab-pdf/%22?ref=kafkaesque.digitalpress.blog), and *meanon* have been truly monumental. Of course, where would we be without the Duolingo Community Forum [Duome](https://forum.duome.eu/?ref=kafkaesque.digitalpress.blog) too - and the admins and moderators who spend their time keeping such a valuable resource. My heart swells with appreciation, and I am profoundly thankful for every contribution made. Thank you – ברוך השם!

Join us on this language journey, and let's make Hebrew learning more interactive and profound!

**UPDATE:**

Audio files have been added to all words on the deck. This is based on Google's Wavenet Algorithm.
