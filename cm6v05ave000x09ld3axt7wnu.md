Hi everyone,

I made this table using a kind submission from Ariel Ayalon who gave me the submissions from a poll of 33,000 Israelis. I weighed the poll [based on age, gender, education, year of aliyah, religion and religious identity](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xqJZPPVO-HMJBAon2NZpiaq8WREGuIIvEX5aCmK9uos/edit) - using the [CBS Social Survey](https://www.cbs.gov.il/en/Pages/Social-Survey-Generator-new.aspx). Then I broke down the results by various demographics, and have published it as a chart for you to see. I hope you find it as interesting as I do!

I'd like to thank Chris Terry (as ever!) - but in addition [Hovav Dror](https://quantitatively.club/) and [Prof. Dror Feitelson](https://netunim.wordpress.com/) each who maintain very informative Israeli data blogs. As well as the kind submission from Ariel Ayalon who runs the [Sample Project Panel](https://www.midgampanel.com/).

The most interesting thing to do, in my opinion, is to click the headers to sort the parties by their strongest and weakest demographics.

Let me know what you would like to see next!

The code is on [Github](https://github.com/JacobWeinbren/Israeli-2022-Survey), as always.
