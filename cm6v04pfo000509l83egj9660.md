Hi all,

I've been testing ways to make the maps load quicker and run more efficiently. One method I've been experimenting with is increasing the gamma of the maps as a form of compression. This means that for a 6, 7, or 8-sided shape, it will render fewer sides (say 3 or 4) when you zoom out, partially preserving the shape. When you zoom in, it shows the full extent of the building. This should allow the maps to load even on a cheap phone with poor Wi-Fi, even when rendering millions of buildings zoomed out.

Enjoy the maps!
